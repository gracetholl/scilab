Scilab
======

Open source, cross-platform numerical computational package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language.
Scilab is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. 
It has been a useful tool for scientists and engineers since it was first released in [1994](https://www.scilab.org/about/scilab-open-source-software).

---------------

Scilab allows for easy computation with its matrix-based data types. It has many notable applications:

1. Statistics and statistical analysis

2. Mathematical modeling

3. Audio and image processing

4. Optimization

5. Engineering simulations

Scilab is also notable for having built-in memory management and a dynamic type system.
